# URL Health Checker

A modern web application for checking the health and availability of multiple URLs in parallel. Built with Django, Celery, Redis, and React.

## Features

- âœ¨ Check multiple URLs simultaneously
- ðŸš€ Asynchronous processing with real-time progress
- ðŸ’¾ Caching of successful results
- ðŸ”„ Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- ðŸ“Š Detailed error categorization
- ðŸ“ˆ Real-time task monitoring with Flower
- ðŸŽ¯ Process URLs in optimized chunks
- âš¡ Fast response times with Redis caching

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Django + Django REST Framework
- Celery for async task processing
- Redis for caching and message broker
- SQLite for development database

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Material-UI components
- Axios for HTTP requests

### DevOps
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Flower for Celery monitoring

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd url-health-checker
```

2. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Access the application:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Flower (Celery monitoring): http://localhost:5555

## API Endpoints

### Check URLs
```http
POST /api/url-checks/check_urls/
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "urls": [
        "https://example.com",
        "https://google.com"
    ]
}
```

### Get Batch Status
```http
GET /api/url-checks/batch_status/?batch_id=<batch_id>
```

### Get Batch Results
```http
GET /api/url-checks/batch_results/?batch_id=<batch_id>
```

## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend Service**: React SPA for user interaction
- **Backend Service**: Django/DRF API
- **Celery Workers**: Async task processing
- **Redis**: Message broker and cache
- **Flower**: Task monitoring

## Error Handling

The system handles various types of errors:
- DNS resolution failures
- SSL certificate errors
- Connection timeouts
- Too many redirects
- Server errors (4xx, 5xx)

## Development

```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py test

# Frontend tests
docker-compose exec frontend npm test
```

## Performance Optimizations

- URLs are processed in chunks of 10
- Successful results are cached for 5 minutes
- Celery workers process tasks in parallel
- Frontend implements smart polling
- Redis caching reduces database load

## Monitoring

Access Flower dashboard at http://localhost:5555 to monitor:
- Active tasks
- Task history
- Worker status
- Queue metrics
